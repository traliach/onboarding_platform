## What it does

- **Internal dashboard** (JWT auth, httpOnly cookie) for staff to create
  clients, watch their provisioning run step-by-step, retry failed steps,
  and read cross-client analytics.
- **Client portal** (UUID token URL, no password) for each new client to
  track their own onboarding in plain English — no internal step names,
  no technical logs, no other clients' data.
- **REST API** that accepts client submissions, writes the client and the
  job/steps to PostgreSQL inside one transaction, then enqueues the job
  on BullMQ. The worker runs the tier-specific step set (3 for Basic,
  6 for Professional, 7 for Enterprise), updating `job_steps` as it goes.
- **Analytics** endpoint surfaces completion rate, average step duration,
  and per-step failure frequency directly from PostgreSQL.
- **Observability**: every EC2 ships metrics to a dedicated Prometheus
  instance; Grafana renders a fleet-overview dashboard and an
  onboarding-jobs dashboard. Four alerting rules are provisioned and
  verified firing (instance down, queue depth, high memory, job failure
  rate).

Provisioning steps (IAM user, S3 scaffold, Slack channel, etc.) are
**simulated** — the side effects are logged, not real AWS / Slack SDK
calls. The portfolio focus is the orchestration layer, the observability
surface, and the infrastructure story, not the integrations themselves.

## Status

| Area | State |
|------|-------|
| Backend | **Complete.** API, worker, dual auth (JWT + UUID token), analytics, tier-based step registry, retry endpoint, Docker image, 45-test suite. |
| Frontend | **Complete.** Dashboard (clients + analytics tabs), portal page, login, client detail with live step polling and retry UI. Deployed to Vercel free tier. |
| Local stack | **Complete.** `docker compose up` starts the full backend in one command. |
| Terraform | **Complete.** VPC, security groups (per-tier SG segmentation), 5 × t2.micro EC2s, ALB, SSM VPC endpoints, and the EC2 SSM/ECR instance role. S3 remote state, DynamoDB locking, ECR, and the GitHub OIDC role are account prerequisites created outside the app root. |
| Ansible | **Complete.** Six idempotent roles (common, db, worker, app, prometheus, grafana) run in order by a single master playbook over SSM. |
| Monitoring | **Complete.** `monitoring/` holds Prometheus scrape config + 4 alert rules + 2 provisioned Grafana dashboards. Ansible deploys from the repo — nothing is hand-configured on the EC2. |
| CI/CD | **Complete.** Three path-scoped workflows. `server.yml` builds + pushes to ECR on main. `infra.yml` runs `terraform apply` + Ansible + ALB smoke test on merge. |
| Docs | **Complete.** 10 ADRs, `cost.md`, `architecture.md`, `deploy.md`, `runbook.md`. |

Built commit-by-commit with plain-English messages — `git log --oneline` is
the change history.

  Port 22 closed. Shell access: SSM Session Manager only.
  No NAT gateway — SSM/ECR traffic via VPC interface endpoints.

## Quick start — local backend

Prerequisites: Docker Desktop, Node 22+, Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/traliach/onboarding_platform.git
cd onboarding_platform
cp .env.example .env          # fill in JWT_SECRET and admin password
docker compose up -d          # postgres, redis, api, worker
docker compose exec api node dist/server/src/db/seed.js   # admin + sample clients
```

Then:

- API root:       http://localhost:4000
- Health:         http://localhost:4000/health
- Readiness:      http://localhost:4000/health/ready
- Default admin:  `admin@onboarding.local` / `changeme-dev-only`

Log in, create a client, and watch the worker output stream step-by-step in
`docker compose logs -f worker`.

Tests:

```bash
cd server
npm test
```

45 tests run in under two seconds (passwords, tokens, step handlers,
workflow registry, auth and invite HTTP integration).

## Auth — two patterns, one project

- **Internal dashboard** uses JWT, issued on `POST /auth/login`, stored
  in an **httpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookie** — never localStorage, never
  returned in the response body. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
  (minimum cost 12 enforced at config-validation time). All `/clients`,
  `/jobs`, and `/analytics` routes are guarded by the JWT middleware.
- **Client portal** uses **UUID token URLs** generated server-side by
  Postgres `gen_random_uuid()` at client creation. The email the client
  receives carries the link `https://<host>/portal/<uuid>`; no password,
  no session, no other client's data visible. `GET /portal/:token`
  returns plain-English labels instead of internal step names.

The invite-only registration decision is captured in
[ADR-009](./docs/adr/009-invite-only-registration.md). The security contract is
simple: JWTs stay in httpOnly cookies, portal tokens are scoped UUID links, and
new staff accounts require an authenticated admin invite.

## Cost

Target: **~$47/month** end-to-end (AWS fleet + Vercel frontend).

| Resource                  | Spec                  | Monthly  |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|----------|
| 5 × t2.micro EC2          | app/worker/db/prom/graf | $42.35 |
| EBS (5 × 30 GiB gp3)      | $0.08/GiB             | $12.00   |
| ALB                       | $0.0225/hr + LCUs     | $4.50    |
| Data transfer             | Intra-AZ free         | ~$1.00   |
| Frontend (Vercel)         | Free tier             | $0.00    |
| **Total (post-optimisations)** |                  | **~$47** |

Key cost decisions:

- **No NAT gateway** — SSM VPC endpoints instead (ADR-001). Saves ~$33/mo.
  First-install package artifacts still need an explicit strategy:
  controlled outbound HTTPS, S3-staged artifacts, or pre-baked AMIs.
- **No bastion EC2** — SSM Session Manager gives shell to every private
  host (ADR-001).
- **BullMQ on the worker EC2** — no managed-queue per-request billing
  (ADR-002).
- **Split Prometheus and Grafana onto two t2.micros** — fleet uniformity
  and failure isolation (ADR-003).
- **Self-managed PostgreSQL with explicit tuning** — 1 GiB box, no RDS
  (ADR-004).
- **Vercel free tier for the frontend** — zero ops overhead, per-PR
  preview URLs, global CDN (ADR-006).

Full breakdown with upgrade-path pricing in [`docs/cost.md`](./docs/cost.md).

## Observability

- **Prometheus** scrapes `node_exporter` on all 5 EC2s plus the API's
  `/metrics` endpoint. BullMQ queue counts (waiting, active, completed,
  failed) are polled from Redis every 30 s by the API process and exposed
  as gauges. Scrape interval 15 s, retention 15 days.
- **Grafana** provisions two dashboards as code:
  `monitoring/grafana/dashboards/fleet-overview.json` and
  `onboarding-jobs.json`. Both are committed; there is no click-to-edit
  dashboard in production.
- **Alerts** (`monitoring/prometheus/alerts.yml`): `EC2Down`,
  `JobQueueDepth`, `HighMemoryUsage`, `JobFailureRate`. Each is verified
  firing by deliberately triggering the condition.

The monitoring EC2s are deliberately separate from the app/worker tier —
see **ADR-003** for the reasoning (fleet uniformity + failure isolation
beats the ~$2-3/month delta from consolidating onto one t3.small).

## CI/CD

Three path-scoped GitHub Actions workflows — a CSS change never triggers
Terraform, an infra change never deploys the frontend. See [ADR-008](./docs/adr/008-ci-cd-pipeline.md).

| Workflow | Trigger path | On PR | On merge to main |
|----------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| `client.yml` | `client/` | lint, typecheck, test, build | + Vercel deploy |
| `server.yml` | `server/` | lint, typecheck, test, Docker build | + push to ECR |
| `infra.yml` | `infra/`, `monitoring/` | fmt + validate + plan (posted as PR comment) | + apply + Ansible + ALB smoke test |

AWS authentication is OIDC — no static access keys in GitHub secrets.

## Repository layout

```

  terraform/    VPC, security groups, 5 × EC2, ALB, SSM endpoints, EC2 IAM role
  ansible/      six idempotent roles, master playbook, vault-encrypted secrets
monitoring/     Prometheus config + alert rules + Grafana dashboard JSON
